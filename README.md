# Intermediate Representation Compiler

This project implements a recursive-descent parser and intermediate representation (IR) generator for a custom programming language.

## Overview
- Parses a simplified language with variables, arithmetic expressions, conditionals, loops, and switch statements
- Builds an instruction-level intermediate representation using jumps and conditional jumps
- Demonstrates core compiler design concepts

## Key Concepts
- Recursive-descent parsing
- Symbol table management
- Control-flow graph construction
- Intermediate code generation

## Language & Tools
- C++
- Custom lexer
- Instruction-based IR
